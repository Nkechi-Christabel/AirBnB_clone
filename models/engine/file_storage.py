class FileStorage:
    """
    Handles the serialization and deserialization of objects to and
    from a JSON file.

    Attributes:
        __file_path (str): The path to the JSON file used for storage.
        __objects (dict): A dictionary that stores objects by <class
                          name>.id.

    Public Methods:
        all(self): Returns a dictionary of all stored objects.
        new(self, obj): Adds an object to the storage dictionary.
        save(self): Serializes and saves the storage dictionary to the
                    JSON file.
        reload(self): Deserializes and loads objects from the JSON file
                      (if it exists).

    Usage:
        To store and manage objects persistently, create an instance of
        FileStorage. Use the public methods to interact with the stored
        objects.
